Machine Translation Post-Editing (MTPE) is a process designed to save you time and cost involved in translation. It has two components. In the first, the source content is translated by a machine translation software. In the second, a human editor improves the translation of the machine. In the end, you leverage both: the power of artificial intelligence and the hard-to-replicate human expertise.
