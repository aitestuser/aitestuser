<h1 style="color:blue;">The Best Web Sites for .. .</h1>
<p>If you are online and want or need to find out
what is happening in the world, you can go to any
of many news sites.<br>
<i style="color:red;">The site I use the most is the online New York Times.</i></p>

<p style="color:green;"><b>One disadvantage of this site</b>is that to go beyond
the first page, you need to subscribe. <br>
It is free,
but you need to choose a logon name and a password. However, you can arrange to save the information on
the computer that you typically use. <u>If you do this,

you do not need to be concerned with logging on.</u></p>
The New York Times site is changed a few times during
the day. It contains audio and video.
